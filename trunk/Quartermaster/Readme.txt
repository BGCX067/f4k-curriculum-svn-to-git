Forage for Knowledge - Quartermaster
====================================

This directory will contain the project journal and design notes for 
the 'Quartermaster' project.

It is a PostgreSQL project for organising both single items of equipment, 
standard work-bench sets of equipment, and kits of equipment.

The "Quartermaster's store" at a F4K location works like a kind of 
public library for community-owned gear.


Data will be stored in the database by a variety of methods, including
psql, python, and GUI.

Reports will usually be by means of cocoon, as that provides so much
flexibility.
